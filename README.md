# Project-1
Beaker project 1

Technoligies used: HTML, CSS, Javascript, AJAX, jQuery

Live link: https://eager-nightingale-8bda5f.netlify.app/

API used: https://swapi.dev/

Approach taken: I wanted to be able to pull information about the characters and the planets in the films from the Star Wars API when the user clicks on the associated film poster. I pulled most of the information using ajax and jquery, however, the API made that very tedious.

Unsolved problems: I had difficulty finding posters that I wanted all in the same size, so I hard coded the sizes. The posters end up becoming a little distorted when in a mobile screen-size, but the layout is still how I want it.
